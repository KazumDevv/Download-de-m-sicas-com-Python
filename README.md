"# The Selenium library was used to do an automated search to find the name of the songs. This way it is possible to modify the 'band' field with the desired string and run the code"

"# For the download, the pytubefix library was used to access youtube and download the audio of the first video that appears (the search is automated to always try to put the correct song at the top of the list)."
